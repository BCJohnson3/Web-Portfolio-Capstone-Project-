				that is really hard to do. We tend to always turn it back around to bragging on our kids. When it comes to my photography I do have to give 
				it all to my kids though. I have 2 handsome, rambunctious little boys, Gavin and Carter, that are my sunshine when it is raining. When I had Gavin, 
				I picked up a camera and never turned back. At first it was about capturing the love I had for him, and then I slowly realized the love I had for the 
				camera. You see, it was about memories, ones that I knew one day could fade away and just like every other mother I wanted to keep him little forever. 
				The only way I knew for sure I could remember every drooling smile, every messy meal, those chubby cheeks, and those 10 perfect toes was to capture it 
				through the camera.  I realized that through photography I could hold on to those little memories forever. 
				
				I would love to be given the opportunity to help you capture those precious memories. Please browse my page, get to know my work. If you would like 
				to set up a session, I would love to work with you!
